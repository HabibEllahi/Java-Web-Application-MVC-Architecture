# Java Web Application – MVC Architecture

This repository contains an academic Java web application developed as part of the **Telematic Services** course in the **Telecommunications Engineering degree** at the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU).

The project follows the **Model–View–Controller (MVC)** design pattern and demonstrates the development of a basic web service using Java technologies.

## 📌 Project Overview

The application is a simple web-based system that processes user input through HTML forms, applies business logic on the server side, and returns structured responses to the user.

It is designed to illustrate:
- Server-side programming with Java
- MVC architectural principles
- Web application deployment using Apache Tomcat

## 🧱 Architecture

The project is structured according to the MVC pattern:

- **Model**  
  Contains the business logic and operations.

- **View**  
  HTML pages responsible for user interaction and presentation.

- **Controller**  
  Java Servlets that handle requests, validate input, and coordinate between the model and the views.
